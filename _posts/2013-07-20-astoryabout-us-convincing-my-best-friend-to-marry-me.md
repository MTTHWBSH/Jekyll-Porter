Like most developers, I try and employ my tools at hand to solve problems in ways that some might not consider the status quo. So naturally, when it came to trying to convince the most [amazing girl][kateTwitter] in the world (my best friend, and at the time girlfriend) to marry me, I chose a channel I often communicate with: the web!

The ultimate goal of the experience was to tell the story of our relationship, and eventually lead the fiance-to-be back to where it all started (I would then pop the question). So I recruited two heroic collaborators, one [illustrator][gabeTwitter]Â and another [developer][joshTwitter].

My role in the project quickly shifted between art direction, UXD, IxD, front-end development, and project management (I&#8217;ll provide a more flushed out review of our process in an upcoming blog post). The aim of this project was to encompass our relationship in creative storytelling, and after recognizing the movement and playfulness of the illustrations we settled on an interactive/animated slideshow-type interface.

Due to the primary audience (one person) and focus (storytelling) of the project, the scope was pretty well defined from the get go. Although I and the developer are huge proponents of the open web and RWD, there were times where we chose not to implement emerging tech as to not deter from the experience (for instance not using CSS3 animations that just weren&#8217;t there in comparison to jQuery easing). Since this project was time contingent and so focused on a single user, we weren&#8217;t much affected by this, but like many other projects the scope changed dramatically in an instant. After pushing this public, the site gained traction and was shared by several heavy influencers (including articles on [The Huffington Post][huffPo] and [mLive][mLive], and a special mention from [awwwards.com][awwwards]). In four days, we had 7,500 views (with several more to come) from a myriad of different devices and browsers that we hadn&#8217;t prepared for.

In any other project instance, this would require a huge pivot in strategy to meet our new users where they&#8217;re coming from; and although the &#8220;use&#8221; for this project is over we&#8217;re still considering pushing a second version to support cases like this. If you&#8217;d like to critique the code or are interested in extending the platform into something less one-user-centric, the project is available on [GitHub][github].

Oh, I guess I left out one minor detail&#8230; she said yes!
