More and more of my side projects are becoming custom WordPress themes because of its support and flexibility. Most of these do not use the standard &#8220;out of the box&#8221; paradigms of WordPress, and thus come with a lot of dependencies. Things like setting up a <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> structure, changing the default homepage from &#8216;index&#8217;, or hooking up standard assets with WP pathways can be time consuming. To combat this, I&#8217;ve started <a href="https://github.com/MTTHWBSH/Beerd" target="_blank">Beerd</a>. Beerd is a boilerplate for custom WordPress themes that aligns to my standard workflow (though it could be helpful for others to fork and build upon!). It&#8217;s currently in its baby stages on GitHub, but I&#8217;ll continue to build it up (and write better documentation in the readme) in the future.
