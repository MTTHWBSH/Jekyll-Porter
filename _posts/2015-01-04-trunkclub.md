Since joining the Trunk Club Engineering team in early October, 2013, I've traversed the design and engineering gamut ranging from product discovery / design to application development. Though business needs required my role to be a bit of a generalist at times, my focus for most projects is on product / interface design and UI engineering for web and iOS applications. These projects span a period ranging from a small tech team within a sole Chicago headquarters to working with dozens of world class engineers for [offices across the nation][link3] (not to mention [being acquired][link2]).
