As someone who&#8217;s long been borderline obsessive about data and its analysis, I wanted to do something that could combine this passion with my visual design interests. To do this, I decided to create a sort of &#8220;sandbox&#8221; and teach myself the <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3.js</a> library (a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data). The site follows my progression from simply generating an HTML table from a CSV document, to creating interactive visualizations from large data sets.

In a separate graphic design class, I was tasked with creating a two-page magazine layout that took one side of an argument. Although I might not share the same views on big data, when I stumbled upon Matthew Ingram&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/02/01/the-increasingly-blurry-line-between-big-data-and-big-brother/" target="_blank">article</a> comparing big data to &#8220;big brother&#8221; I thought it would be perfect to accompany my site. You can see that below, and my sandbox <a href="http://mtthwbsh.com/data-viz" target="_blank">here</a>.

As lead developer for Beyond the Banks (a digital time capsule for MSU&#8217;s class of 2013) I was tasked with leading a team of new developers, content creators, and designers over the course of a semester. The nature of this project allowed us to use experimental front-end technologies, as well as afforded me to teach new developers to create clean/semantic markup, the basics of version control (the repo can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/MTTHWBSH/sta499" target="_blank">here</a>), and the use of emerging HTML5/CSS3 methods. This was also a practice in content strategy and design for the web for class members with little experience both.
