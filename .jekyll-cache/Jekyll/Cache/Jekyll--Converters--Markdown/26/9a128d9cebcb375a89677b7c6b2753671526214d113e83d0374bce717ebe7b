<p>During my time at <a href="http://getsnworks.com/">SNWorks</a> I spent my time as a bit of a utility knife, spending most of my time in front-end development / UI design and eventually leading the development team on several client projects (as well as our own <a href="http://getsnworks.com/">statenews.com</a>).</p>

<p>My most common projects involved full services for university news outlets; which included integration and feature development on our in-house developed CMS “Gryphon” (a content management system tailored to newsrooms), UI design and development for client sites, and support / training for stakeholders. Client projects I led included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.otterbein360.com/">Otterbein360</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.lanthorn.com/">Grand Valley Lanthorn</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.themichigantimes.com/">The Michigan Times</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nearduke.com/housing">Near Duke Housing</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dailygamecock.com/">The Daily Gamecock</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All projects touted RWD practices for consumption on the go, with applications ranging from straightforward news outlets to a responsive web app to find student housing:</p>
