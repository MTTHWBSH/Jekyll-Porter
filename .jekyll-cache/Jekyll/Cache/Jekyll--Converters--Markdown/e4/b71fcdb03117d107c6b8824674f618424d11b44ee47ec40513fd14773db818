<p>As lead designer and developer for an Eli Review marketing site redesign, I was challenged with taking a large amount of content provided for users (as well as potential users) and drilling it down to more concise, actionable overviews. I then created a custom WordPress theme consisting of modular page templates built out of a front-end component guide created as part of the project.</p>
